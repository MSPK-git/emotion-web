  abstract = {Color is a ubiquitous perceptual stimulus that is often considered in terms of aesthetics. Here we review theoretical and empirical work that looks beyond color aesthetics to the link between color and psychological functioning in humans. We begin by setting a historical context for research in this area, particularly highlighting methodological issues that hampered earlier empirical work. We proceed to overview theoretical and methodological advances during the past decade and conduct a review of emerging empirical findings. Our empirical review focuses especially on color in achievement and affiliation/attraction contexts, but it also covers work on consumer behavior as well as food and beverage evaluation and consumption. The review clearly shows that color can carry important meaning and can have an important impact on people’s affect, cognition, and behavior. The literature remains at a nascent stage of development, however, and we note that considerable work on boundary conditions, moderators, and real-world generalizability is needed before strong conceptual statements and recommendations for application are warranted. We provide suggestions for future research and conclude by emphasizing the broad promise of research in this area.},

  abstract = {People experience emotions when playing videogames, and these emotions are a main reason for playing. In our research, we examine whether colors can be used in videogames to elicit specific emotions. In an experiment we used a videogame in which four different colors, associated with four specific emotions, were used in four different conditions. After each condition we measured the players’ emotional responses by means of a Self-Assessment Manikin questionnaire. We found that the color red evoked a highlyaroused, negative emotional response, while the color yellow evoked a positive emotional response. These results were significantly different from the emotional responses measured for other colors. Furthermore, we found that inexperienced players showed much more explicit reactions to colors than experienced players. We conclude that the use of colors is a suitable method for game designers to elicit specific emotional responses from the players.},

  abstract = {The authors hypothesize that environmental cues provide affective information that directly influences processing strategy, with positively valenced (i.e., happy) cues leading to nonsystematic processing and negatively valenced (i.e., sad) cues leading to systematic processing. In Study 1, college students were exposed to a set of problem solving tasks (PSTs) printed on either red, white, or blue paper and under the condition of either low or high motivation to process. Results show that in the low motivation condition the blue and white paper Ss out-performed the red paper Ss, while in the high motivation condition there were no effects. Also, there were no differences in mood among the groups. In Study 2, Ss completed both simple and complex PSTs on either red or blue paper. Results conceptually replicated Study 1. For complex tasks, blue paper led to better performance than did red paper; however, no difference was apparent for simple tasks. In Study 3, Ss completed a set of simple PSTs on either red, white, or blue paper and evaluated their affective state. The red paper was perceived as conveying more positive affect than the white or blue paper. The results are discussed in the context of an extension of the cognitive tuning hypothesis to the area of environmental cues. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

An experiment was carried out in a laboratory: photos taken and sounds recorded on-site were shown to participants, who were then asked to answer questionnaires based on approach–avoidance behavior and pleasure-arousal-dominance emotion theories. The results showed that background music can increase individuals’ positive evaluation of the environment, facilitate approach behavior, and enhance pleasure and dominance emotions, while foreground music can increase arousal distinctly. The effect of music in a large atrium space is significantly greater when compared to other spaces. Men have a higher level of satisfaction and arousal than do women with specific music settings, while older people are less sensitive to music than their younger counterparts and more tolerant of the environment.},
